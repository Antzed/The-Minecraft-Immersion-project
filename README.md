# The-Minecraft-Immersion-project
A project dedicated to making the most immersive Minecraft world possible using various methods.

People always think of graphical realism when they think of the word "immersion", but this project is not for that. Instead, it will focus more on the logistic side of immersion. 

**Things should make sense in this world.**
